    "Class vs Object\n",
    "A class like Complex is just a template, like a recipe. An object like c1 or c2 is an actual dish you made using that recipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "self\n",
    "Inside the class, self refers to the current object. So self.real means the real attribute of the object you’re working with.\n",
    "\n",
    "init method\n",
    "It’s a special method called automatically when you create a new object. It sets the initial values of your object’s attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "print() method\n",
    "Custom method you wrote to display the complex number nicely.\n",
    "\n",
    "add() method\n",
    "Another method that modifies your object by adding another complex number’s real and imaginary parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating objects\n",
    "When you write c1 = Complex(10, 20), you create an object of your Complex class with 10 as real and 20 as imaginary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using methods\n",
    "You call methods with dot notation like c1.print() or c1.add(c2). This is how you interact with your object."
