    "## üéØ What is Abstraction?\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction means **hiding complex implementation details** and showing only the essential features of an object or system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple words, you don‚Äôt need to know how something works internally to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps:\n",
    "- Reduce complexity\n",
    "- Focus only on relevant details\n",
    "- Keep code clean and modular\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### üí° Real-Life Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of driving a car:\n",
    "- You use the steering wheel, brake, and accelerator.\n",
    "- But you don‚Äôt care how the engine is firing or how fuel injection works.\n",
    "\n",
    "That‚Äôs abstraction ‚Äî you interact only with what you need.\n",

    "### üîß Abstraction in Python (via abstract classes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports abstraction using the `abc` module (Abstract Base Classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Animal(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, any class that inherits `Animal` must implement `make_sound()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Bark\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Meow\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "d = Dog()\n",
    "d.make_sound()  # Bark\n",
    "\n",
    "c = Cat()\n",
    "c.make_sound()  # Meow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you try to create an object of `Animal` directly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = Animal()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You‚Äôll get an error ‚Äî because `Animal` is abstract and incomplete without its method being defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîê TL;DR\n",
    "\n",
    "- Abstraction = hiding unnecessary implementation details  \n",
    "- Achieved in Python using `abc.ABC` and `@abstractmethod`  \n",
    "- Forces subclasses to follow a common interface  \n",
    "- Keeps your design clean and focused on \"what\" something does, not \"how\"\n"
